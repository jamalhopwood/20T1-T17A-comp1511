# Tutorial 08 Week 8

## Goals

1. Be aware that assignment 2 has been released
2. Structs
   1. Initialising
   2. Accessing fields in a struct
3. Linked lists
   1. Structure
   2. Difference to array

## Structs

What is a struct?

How do you access elements in a struct?

Help me define an example struct in `student.c`.

Help initialise the struct and add data to some of its fields?

Help move the above implementation into a function which returns a pointer to a struct. ie. `struct student *init_human_struct(....)`

Where is the memory leak in `student.c`?

## Linked Lists

What is a linked list?

How does it differ to an array?

Add a field to `struct student` which points to another `struct student`.

Now make a linked list of students to represent the humans in this class.

Create another struct `struct class` which has some fields, one of which can point to the start of the linked list of students we made previously.

Write a function which can compare two students marks.

## Assignment 2

What does the structure of assignment 2 look like?

Is it similar to what we have just done in this lesson?

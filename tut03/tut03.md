# Tutorial 03

## Code Review

* Every week a lab pair will have to show us their code from one of the lab exercises
* As a class, we will review the code and offer suggestions etc.
* As individuals we will ask questions
  - Parts we don't understand
  - How the program works logically if it is different to your own
  - Participate, otherwise you won't learn!

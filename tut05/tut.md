## Online Learning

1. Please try to join us in **real time**. I think it's going to be really important for us to stick together and help each other out as much as possible.
2. **Talk** _talk_ **talk** _talk_ **talk**!
3. Turn on your **camera**! (And your microphone when you want to talk!)
4. Please give me lots of **feedback** during and after and before the talks!

It's probably going to be a bumpy ride into these uncharted waters, but lets brave it **together**.

## Functions

### Quick overview

* function prototypes
* parameters
* return values
* calling a function

What about changing integers within a function?

### Arrays (a bit more)

Lets say I had an array in c called `numbers`.

<details>
    <summary>
        How many elements are in the array numbers?
    </summary>
    Haha i'm so funny! You can't actually tell.
</details>

Alright so what was the point of that?

## Pointers

How does one make a pointer and what the blooming heck is it?

<br>

Lets write a function which will return the sum of two integers.

<br>

How could we write the same function without the return statement?

<br>

What happens when we try to change the different values inside the function?
